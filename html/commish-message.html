YOU CAN NOT PICK UP SOMEONE WHO IS ON A BYE. IF YOU DO PICK UP A PLAYER ON A BYE THEY WILL BE DELETED FROM YOUR TEAM THE FIRST TIME, THE SECOND TIME THE BYE PLAYER WILL BE DELETED ALONG WITH YOUR LESS RATED STARTING PLAYER AT THAT POSITION. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE PLAYER POOL BY CHEATING YOU WILL BE PUNISHED BY DONATING TO THE PLAYER POOL. EACH WEEK THE WAIVER PROCESS WILL BE RENEWED PRIOR TO THE TUESDAY MORNING PICKUP TIME OF 9AM EST. IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR WAIVERS YOU MUST FIRST DROP EXTRA PLAYERS YOU WONT BE USING, THEN SELECT THE PLAYERS YOU DESIRE ALONG WITH YOUR CONDITIONAL DROP.IF YOUR TEAM ISNT LEGAL&lt; NO WAIVER THAT WEEK. DURING THE WAIVER PROCESS ALL FREE AGENTS MUST CLEAR A  WAIVER PROCESS AND BE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSIONER BEFORE THEY CAN BE PICKED UP. IF YOUR TEAM IS LOWER IN POWER THAN THE TEAM TRYING TO PICK UP A FREE AGENT, THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT PLAYER AND RESTART THE WAIVER PROCESS. WAIVERS DO NOT APPLY TO INJURY BACKUP PICKUPS AND CAN BE ENFORCED IMMEDIATELY BY CONTACTING THE COMMISSIONER VIA PHONE OR TEXT. WAIVER CONDITIONS WILL BE TURNED OFF ON WEDNESDAY CLEARING ALL TRANSACTIONS AND REMAINING TRANSACTIONS FOR THAT WEEK UNTIL THEY ARE TURNED BACK ON DURING THE WEEKS GAMES.

Once you change your team each week, you must make your lineup legal. You have till Friday or Wednesday each week to make initial changes or call me.  If not completed, I WILL!!!! IF YOU HAVE AN INJURED PLAYER OTHER THAN PROBABLE STATUS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT FROM THE TIME A CROSS IS PUT ON THAT PLAYER UNTIL A HALF HOUR BEFORE GAMETIME TO HAVE FIRST ACCESS TO THEIR BACKUP OR ANY OTHER PLAYER ON THE SAME TEAM AT THE SAME POSITION.  THE PLAYER YOU MOST DESIRE TO BE YOUR STARTER MUST BE IN YOUR STARTING LINEUP UNTIL GAMETIME INCASE HIS CROSS IS LIFTED AND YOUR LINEUP BECOMES ILLEGAL, BECAUSE IF I CHECK LINEUPS AND YOUR ILLEGAL, THEN THE BENCH PLAYER WILL BE DROPPED. THIS IS YOUR BURDEN, NOT MINE!  IF SOMEONE PICKS UP THE OTHER RECIEVER (EXAMPLE) PRIOR TO THE CROSS, THEN THAT IS LEGAL.
               
 You can only have 9 active players 1 qb, 2 rbs, 2 wrs, 1 te, 1 k, 1 def and 1 special team .No one is allowed on your bench unless a player has a bye, then that player goes to the bench and you add a player to start for that week only. After that weeks play you must drop either the new player or your bench player by 5 pm ET on friday. Only injured players and coke snorting suspended players are allowed if you start their backup. Season is first 17 weeks for division winners, weeks 15-17 for the tournament and 17 weeks for total points, breakdown, mvp and power. Any questions or line up changes or help, call me at 307-262-2354.
             Good Luck and Good Bye
